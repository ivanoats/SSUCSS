#My CSS SSUCSS!

Let's face it. ALL CSS frameworks SUCK! They are way too complicated and come with WAY to much opinion of the UI developer that engineered it. Bootstrap and Foundation is great for the people who created it, but every user I encounter I hear the same complaints over and over. The opinions are to overwhelming, the API is overly complex and the hockey stick of complexity once you step outside the solutions they provide is way too steep!

##A no BS Foundation!
