#My CSS SSUCSS!

Let's face it. ALL CSS frameworks SUCK! They are way too complicated and come with WAY to much opinion of the UI developer that engineered it. Bootstrap and Foundation is great for the people who created it, but every user I encounter I hear the same complaints over and over. The opinions are to overwhelming, the API is overly complex and the hockey stick of complexity once you step outside the solutions they provide is way too steep!

Concepts like OOCSS and SMACSS only get us so far. These are good foundational process frameworks, but their teachings stop short of real world solutions. It has been up to the designers and developers to re-invent the wheel time and time again. It's time to have a clear choice in process and implementation technology. It's time for a solution that doesn't over promise quick results by over enforcing it's personal opinion. It's time for a new BS foundation that we can all use!

##A no BS Foundation!
